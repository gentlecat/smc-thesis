I think it's fine to allow re-doing a submission (in case of misclicks), but right now it's not very transparent what's going on if you submit a piece of feedback multiple times - or if you submit a difference piece of feedback.

It's also not at all transparent what the feedback is going to be used for. Is it being collected to generate training datasets? Is it being compared across multiple MBID data submissions?

Also, it's hard to give feedback on ""Genres"" when the genre reported is, say, ""dan"" or ""jaz"" or some other obscure abbreviation. Also, some of those models just don't have genres that fit all pieces of music/audio/acoustic content, and it's hard to give a correct/incorrect measure without knowing what the options actually are (e.g., ""jaz"" might be the most appropriate genre in Tzanetakis(sic) model, even if you wouldn't describe it as jazz normally) - it might make sense to provide a list of options for non-binary choices (""'jaz' is incorrect; it should be 'ele'"").",,"Bugs in essentia are also blocking AB data submission, e.g., https://github.com/MTG/essentia/issues/192"
